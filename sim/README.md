# sim/

The simulation engine — must be testable and runnable entirely without
Unity (Unity is a thin render client, see `unity/README.md`; see
`VISION.md`'s layered architecture). Empty stub for F0. Populated starting
F1, after the spatial primary key ADR (`docs/rules/simulation-principles.md`
failure mode #1) is decided — do not add simulation code here before that
ADR exists, to avoid re-importing VictoriaProject's double-primary-key
defect.
